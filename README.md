I wanted to know the laptop price with the help of a dataset that I found in kaggle. I tried model like: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, SVR, RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBRegressor and StackingRegressor. Have to preproccess the data first to make the prediction more liable.
